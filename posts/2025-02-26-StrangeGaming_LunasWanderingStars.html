	<p>now we're starting to get into games that I've played on stream! if you're interested, you can watch my full playthrough of the game on youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm0l1uA4GH8">here.</a></p>

	<p>if you know of serenity forge, you probably know them from their work on the updated versions of games like doki doki literature club, lisa, and slay the princess. but, it turns out, they also make video games themselves on occasion, and this was the very second one to come out from the studio!</p>
	
	<p>what's kind of fascinating to me about this game is how much of a mobile game it feels like. the entire things is controlled solely with mouse gestures, the gameplay is simple and bite-sized enough to make sporadic on-the-go play sessions easy, and also it borrows a lot from exactly angry birds.</p>
	
	<p>physics puzzles separated into individual challenges, three collectible items per level that act as your score, new abilities unlocked with each new world, this is exactly the same way angry birds was set up. I feel a need to explain this because I genuinely don't know if anybody these days has actually seen gameplay of angry birds. god, remember angry birds?</p>
	
	<p>anyway, it turns out that the gameplay of luna's wandering stars is a lot more involved than angry birds, mostly owing to the fact that the new powers you get in each world aren't just variations on the existing controls, but completely new playstyles that you learn and master individually. this does a great job of keeping things from getting stale, and all of them still utilize the core foundation of physics puzzles to maintain mechanical consistency. probably my favorite was earth's mechanic, where instead of having any control over the moon, you have to indirectly maneuver it by strengthening and lightening earth's gravitational pull. that's really cool!</p>
	
	<p>that said, the terribly self-satisfied energy of the dialogue bits you constantly get throughout the game were honestly making it a little bit difficult for me to get into the game as I was first playing it. there's actually something approaching justification for this that ends up getting explained later, but a lot of it comes dangerously close to feeling like the kind of juvenile pointlessly faux-clever stuff you'd see in the likes of newgrounds flash games. occasionally the writing is genuinely funny, and there are some neat space facts shared throughout the game that I could see being exciting for younger players, but oftentimes the attempts at humor just feel flat.</p>
	
	<p>what surprised me, though, is that this game apparently has a story! and it's actually decently involved! what initially seem like purely non-diegetic tips and one-liners are eventually revealed to be the communications of an actual entity, granted some sort of power to arrange and reset cosmic bodies in order to create the puzzles that you face. when they realize that you somehow persist despite these resets, they develop a tragic sort of fixation on you, naming you "luna" and sharing their burdens with you as the game progresses.</p>
	
	<p>it was heartfelt enough writing to catch me off guard at times, and although that would then usually be undercut by yet another insufferable death message, I can't help but appreciate the effort. they didn't need to do that! they didn't need to include this little story in their space puzzle game, but there was clearly a vision that drove them to do so anyways. regardless of how some of the finer details were executed, it was a game I enjoyed from start to finish and came out of feeling an admiration towards the team for their work.</p>
	
	<p>it's often easy to oversell the first game or two to come out of independent developersâ€”the story of an unknown developer's debut game becoming an overnight sensation is one that's rooted itself into how people think about game development. but games like this, while perhaps unglamorous, represent a much more realistic and promising road to honing one's skills as a game developer, and it was refreshing to see that represented! I always love getting to see these first few steps artists take in their craft, and even if luna's wandering stars didn't light my world on fire, I still find it special in that regard.</p>
