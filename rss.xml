<p>sometimes a game wears its influences in a searingly bright patch right on its sleeve, and that honesty earns a bit of respect from me. what's so special about bug fables is that it's managed to be an even better game than its inspiration in paper mario the thousand year door! better combat, better characters, better everything!</p>

<p>did you know that hit indie publisher serenity forge has actually kept up a steady output of in-house games for a little over a decade? I didn't! this one caught my eye because it's space-themed and I'm the most predictable bitch alive</p>

<p>sometimes a game is so tiny and vague that I can just kinda spin my wheels for a couple hundred words. this is one of those! enjoy this little tiny bit of art analysis while I work on some of the meatier stuff</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><img src="https://princesspengy.space/images/furi1.jpg"></p>
<p>I admire a game that knows exactly what it is, and furi is definitely one of those—it's a retro-style boss rush with a satisfying flow of combat and memorable characters to get you into that white-knuckle flow state many people who grew up with video games remember. but it, like a lot of games that game out around its release year of 2016, is mired in some opinions about that kind of gameplay that are a little bit frustrating!</p>

<p>I'm reviewing something that isn't a video game for once, and it's something I've been looking forward to for a long time. this is a story about identity, about the beautiful messy chaos of life, about the joy of discovering others, and about how huge boobs are actually super cool and we should stop acting like they aren't the coolest thing ever.</p>

<p>I've always been a capital-r romantic person at heart, and nestled within the folds of this game is a story that resonates with that part of me more than I ever expected. for being a game where you stab and get stabbed by an awful lot of women, it's a beautiful and intricate thing filled with life and love and constant surprises. also my very first encounter was with the stranger, and if you know what that means you probably have an idea of just how hard this game came in swinging.</p>

<p>I finally played this one after everybody telling me it's fantastic, but this time, not only did it live up to the hype, it actually surprised me by being better than I expected in basically every way!</p>
<p>also, while writing this, this one got really, really personal. this game isn't fucking around with the mental illness stuff, and it got to me in ways I don't know that I've ever been gotten to before. I talk about some harrowing stuff in this one, but I think it's worth it. this is maybe one of my favorite games I've ever played so far. you should play it, and you should read about it.</p>

<p>in my years on the internet, I've been made to flee the online spaces I came to see as a sort of home time and time again, whether it's a hostile takeover of an instant messaging program or the brutal execution of an entire sphere of content on a social media platform. in talking about these two games where digital worlds take the spotlight, I also ended up writing a sort of eulogy of all these lost homes. I hope it speaks to you</p>

<p>the first blog post in a post-cohost internet, and in the spirit of community, I'm writing about a game from a dear friend of mine that I was recently given the chance to play! behind an unassuming appearance and familiar story, this is a game with a lot of love to give and that tackles just as many big problems as its protagonist, from the consequences of imperialism to dealing with the weight of your loved ones' expectations.</p>

<p>I actually just finished this game the other day, and the moment I did so I immediately declared "I have to write about this. I'm going to write so goddamn much about this."</p>
<p>anodyne 2 is a game about what it means to live through pain¸ and to live with that pain seated tightly in your heart. it's a game that kept surprising me and never settled into a predictable rhythm, yet still beautifully ties everything it has to say together. it's a story that can be appreciated on like ten different levels. I wrote an exhausting amount of words about it but still feel like I have even more to say about it. I hope you play the game, and I hope you enjoy reading about it!</p>

<p>got a fun little visual novel on the docket today! in case the above screenshot didn't make it clear, this one is very online in its sensibilities, but in a way that I can't help but find a little bit endearing. it's also pretty brief, so this summary is pretty brief too!</p>

<p>I wrote a whole lot of words again. I couldn't help it! this game is just one of the most important things in the whole entire world to me. like I know I'm always telling people yume nikki is my favorite game ever, and it's true, but I don't think anything has rocked me at my core harder than this. it's so important. hopefully I've been able to articulate why</p>

<p>games about games are nothing new to mid-2010s independent developers, but this is maybe the most about games I've seen a game ever be! so much so that I ended up going a little bit overboard and writing a much longer diary entry than usual and I am not sorry in the slightest</p>

<p>feels a little bit odd to be reviewing a game from so long ago—this one's less of a contemporary review and more of a historical curiosity at this point! bastion also mostly makes me want to play transistor again, but I don't think that's really a fault of the game itself. I'm simply a lesbian</p>

<p>what a sweet little game! a delightful homage to retro adventure games with that special sense of humor that gradually clings to you like pollen after spending a long enough time on mid-to-late-2010s internet hangouts.</p>
<p>unfortunately, as is proving to be the case with fandom smash hits of around the turn of the decade with a narrative focus on mental illness, I once again regret to inform you that I have Takes about how this game ends up handling that.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>I feel like as strange gaming diaries has progressed as a series, I find myself more ferociously critical than I am celebratory, which isn't what I envisioned these writing exercises as being like tone-wise when I started. I'm not trying to make a Thing out of elaborate takedowns of years-old independently developed darlings, it just so happens that a lot of the games I played back in 2023 (and am thus spending 2024 catching up on) were games that left me feeling kinda frustrated!</p>

<p>I love it when a game proudly and explicitly calls itself "inspired by yume nikki" so I have yet another opportunity to talk about my favorite video game. the two games themselves are a bit of a mixed bag—unsurprising given the well they're drawing from—but it gives me the perfect chance to talk about surreal themes in games, and why "there is a big eyeball and it is staring at you" does not the style of yume nikki make</p>

<p>a delightful little scifi yarn in which you're a detective trying to piece together a murder case on board a space station. not solve a murder case, mind you; the prime suspect is a faceless AI named MAL. the perpetrator couldn't really be more obvious here</p>

<p>so there I was, playing The RPG Maker Game About Depression in its final form. I saw it through to the end and enjoyed it the whole time. but, despite it all, the only lingering feeling I have towards it is a gnawing pit of frustration in my chest. if you'll allow me, let me maybe try to elaborate on why that is!</p>

<p>one more move of all of my personal belongings later, and I'm back! this time I'm talking about a game jennifer raye made that absolutely destroyed me in a way nothing else has. this one might get more rambley and less cohesive than the other diary entries, but that's okay. it feels fitting that way</p>

<p>a while back I played serre by @insertdisc5, who has apparently in the intervening time made another game that's had quite a lot of buzz! nothing will beat the amount of buzz in this game though. heh. get it cuz. cuz she's a bee. cuz there's a bee in it. heheh.</p>
<p>anyway if the truly volcanic amount of sapphic tension in the above image is as to your liking as it is mine, give the game a shot and feel free to <a href="https://princesspengy.github.io/posts/2024-04-25-StrangeGaming_Serre">give my review a read!</a></p>]]>
