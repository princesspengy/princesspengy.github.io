			<h3>GigglingGoblin</h3>
			<img class="friend-image" src="\images\gigglinggoblin.png">
			<p>a writer of joyously devilish hypnosmut, and one of my biggest inspirations for my own writing. come for the seductive supernatural beauties and top-class erotica, stay for the evocative and thought-provoking worldbuilding! read her work on <a href="https://readonlymind.com/@GigglingGoblin/">readonlymind (18+),</a> and other miscellany on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gigglinggoblin.bsky.social">bluesky (18+)!!</a></p>

			<h3>SleepyGayCutie</h3>

			<p>my wonderful wonderful girlfriend, a cartoonist by trade with a penchant for cute girls in glasses getting hypnotized and otherwise mind controlled in an endless variety of ways! she's partnered with the abovementioned gigglinggoblin to provide the occasional bit of art, and she's drawing her own stuff over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sleepygaycutie.bsky.social">bluesky (18+)!</a></p>

			<h3>Bee Braun</h3>
			<img class="friend-image" src="\images\beebraun.png">
			<p>develops games!! we talk about video games a whole ton and despite making games that might seem outwardly simplistic, they have such an intense thoughtfulness towards the medium that makes their stuff an absolute delight. they have a website you can visit <a href="https://bumblebee.city/">here!</a></p>

			<h3>Utilitymonstergirl</h3>
			<img class="friend-image" src="\images\utilitymonstergirl.png">
			<p>the finest purveyor I know of queer media that chooses violence on purpose, alexi is a webcomic artist who blends comedy, pornography, transgressiveness, and philosophy into a big garishly colored soup that still comes out tasting absolutely delicious. check out her <a href="https://utilitymonstergirl.dreamwidth.org/">her blog!</a></p>

			<h3>inverseaxolotl</h3>
			<img class="friend-image" src="\images\inverseaxolotl.jpg">
			<p>webcomic author, animator, and clownfucker nonpareil. currently working on all kinds of stories about people being horrible disasters and making a lot of other art on the side, which you can see most of on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/inverseaxolotl/">instagram!</a> she also has a sideblog where she draws kinky porny goodness of all kinds over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edith-is-dead.bsky.social">bluesky (18+)!</a></p>

			<img class="friend-image" src="\images\sieversii.jpg">
			<p>makes kickass electronic music, influenced by edm of the 2010s (she listened to a lot of monstercat releases back in the day) among a few other things. also she does her own vocals and in my extremely unbiased opinion it's like being serenaded by an angel? listen to her newest releases on <a href="https://malussieversii.bandcamp.com/">bandcamp!</a></p>
