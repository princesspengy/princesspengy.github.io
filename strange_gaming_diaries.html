	  <h1>strange gaming diaries</h1>
      <p>this is a series of journaling exercises where I'll be talking about and quasi-reviewing all of the games I've completed. I call it a diary because I hold it to no particular standard of objectivism or journalistic quality: they are the rawest and most unfiltered of the impressions a game has left on me after having played it, most of the time with a heavy focus on narrative themes and storytelling, because those are the things I like most! every game is made to say something, and I like seeing what I feel compelled to say back.</p>
      
      <p>currently, I'm catching up on a bunch of games I played in the back half of 2023 and the front half of 2024. after that's done, though, this series will be populated by first impressions written near-immediately after finishing a game!</p>

      <p>with that said, welcome to the masterpost! this will be where I put links to all of the individual diary entries I've written. have a seat and take a browse, why don'tcha?</p>
